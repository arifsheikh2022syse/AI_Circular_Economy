AI Models for Demand-Supply Forecasting in Circular Economy Marketplaces
This repository contains Python notebooks for implementing and simulating AI models designed to forecast demand, predict supply, and optimize pricing within a Circular Economy (CE) marketplace. The models included range from time-series forecasting to reinforcement learning approaches, providing a flexible foundation for demand-supply forecasting in CE systems.

Note: These scripts serve as base models and are intended for educational and initial development purposes. The quality of results will depend heavily on data quality, hyperparameter tuning, and model adjustments according to specific use cases. There is no support for these models, and they are not guaranteed to provide optimized results without further customization.

Important Notes
Input and Output Paths: The paths to input and output files need to be updated in each script based on the user's preference. Example placeholder paths in the scripts include:
input_file_path = r'/path/to/your/inputdata.csv'
output_plot_path = r'/path/to/your/output/plots/'
Ensure you customize these paths to reflect your local or cloud storage structure.
Model Customization: These models are starting points. Effective results will depend on tuning hyperparameters, modifying model architectures, and optimizing based on specific data.
