# AI Models for Circular Economy Resource Management

This repository contains Python scripts developed to model demand, supply, and dynamic pricing within a Circular Economy (CE) digital marketplace. The models include time-series forecasting, reinforcement learning, and regression models, each designed to enhance decision-making for resource allocation.

## Included Models

1. `ARIMA_Model.py`: Time-series forecasting model based on ARIMA for demand and supply prediction.
2. `LSTM_Model.py`: Long Short-Term Memory neural network for capturing long-term dependencies in resource demand and supply.
3. `Prophet_Model.py`: Prophet model for handling seasonality and trends in resource allocation.
4. `Q_Learning_Pricing.py`: Q-learning algorithm for dynamic pricing in CE systems.
5. `Gradient_Boosting_Model.py`: Gradient Boosting Regressor for non-linear demand-supply modeling.
6. `Neural_Network_Model.py`: Neural network for complex, non-linear dependencies across CE variables.
7. ... [Continue listing remaining models briefly]

## Getting Started
1. **Requirements**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed along with the necessary packages (listed in `requirements.txt` if included).
2. **Run the Scripts**: Each model script is standalone. Simply run `python <model_name>.py` after setting up dependencies.
